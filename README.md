# DiscordBot
**DISCLAIMER: Even though the code in this repo is still functional, I do not condone using it since I wrote this poorly at an early age.**

Simple functions for managing topics and corresponding notes as well as discord integration

Download the bot folder, enter your token at the bottom of bot.py and run bot.py.
This code uses the libraries discord, time, asyncio and datetime
